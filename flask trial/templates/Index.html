                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Eliud Ngorongo Njenga a financial and risk analyst from Nairobi Kenya.</p>
                <p>
                    When I finished high school I didnt really know what career path to take (something most of you can relate I am sure) sow I went with the most prestigious course I knew:Actuarial Science. I was fairly good in math but my real passion was computers.Most
                    of my time in campus was spent in the computer lap albiet just to download movies.</p>
                <p>After graduating I didnt get employment at any Actuarial related firm and I slowly lost all hope of ever working in the actuarial field. This whole time my itch for computers was still there and I decided to try and teach myself some form
                    of code with help from my brother. I wasnt really committed to it until he sent me the ALX application and I realised what an amazing opportunity this could be. </p>
                <br>
                <h2> MY MISSION </h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up I was exposed to the world of transport by my parents business. They expereinced alot of challenges from sourcing lorries to the reapir and maintenance of the same I developed a keen interest for logistics as well as travel and I would like
                    to enhance reliability and access to this industry and I believe technology is at the helm of this solution.
                </p>
                <h3>MY VISION</h3>
                <p>
                    My personal vision is to have a life of meaning for myself and others. It is important for me to live my life in a way that shows kindness, care, and concern for family and friends and even strangers.</p>
                <p>
                    Earning respect for myself based on recognition of my accomplishments and abilities, maintains a sense of appreciation of the beauty of nature, and a sense of humor.</p>
                <p>As my namesake said proved:</p>
