# PYTHON PRACTICE

## ABOUT
 This a repo of my coding practice in python using challenges from https://www.codewars.com/dashboard
 
### File Descriptions
 **[check_digit.py](check_digit.py)** - This code is used to check if credit cards are authentic or not. It is closely related to Luhn algorithim.
 
**[complementary.py](complementary.py)** - This interchanges the alphabet "A" to " T", "T" to "A", "G" to "C' and "C" to "G" as seen in a DNA strain.

**[outliers.py](outliers.py)** - Here we check for either the odd or even number in a given list assuming that said list has only one odd number or one even number.

**[reverse.py](reverse.py)** - Simply print lowercase alphabets in reverse ie "z-a"

Comments and doc strings will be added to each python file for easier code review
